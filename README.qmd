#### Abstract

The uncertainty of model outputs is often absent or hidden in R, and tools for interacting with distributions are limited. For example, most prediction methods in R only produce point predictions by default. Although it is possible to obtain other parameters and form the complete distribution, additional knowledge about the distribution’s shape and properties are needed. The distributional package vastly simplifies creating and interacting with distributions in R. Using distributions as standalone vectors reduces makes statistical analysis more accessible with a user-friendly design that encourages accurate use of distributional statistic.

The package provides vectorised distributions through a collection of small, composable elements, enabling the calculation of various statistics without needing to use shape-specific p*/d*/q*/r* functions. Statistics can be easily calculated for distributions within the same vector, regardless of shape, and the modular infrastructure allows additional distributions or new statistical operations to be defined and integrated seamlessly. Manipulating distributions is also supported, including applying transformations, inflating values, truncating, and creating mixtures of distributions. When distributions are stored as data frame columns, these operations integrate seamlessly with tidyverse workflows. A growing number of research software engineers across many domains are using distributional as the foundation for their software. Notable examples include the ggdist extension package for visualising uncertainty in ggplot2, and the epiparameter package for infectious disease modelling.

#### Structure

* Examples of current model output, emphasise accessibility challenges
* Introduction to the basics of distributional
* Comparison with other libraries, while revealing more advanced functionality
* Examples of practical applications (calculating on distributions, ggdist plotting)


#### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the limitations of conventional distribution functions in R

2. Learn how distributional addresses these challenges with a more accessible and extensible design.

3. See how to create, manipulate, and calculate statistics for a range of distributions using distributional’s user interface

4. Understand the design principles of the distributional package, with particular emphasis on its extensibility and interoperability with other R packages.

#### Presenter(s) Bio

Mitchell O'Hara-Wild (he/him) is a PhD candidate at Monash University, creating new techniques and tools for exploring and forecasting time series. He is the lead developer of the tidy time-series forecasting tools fable and feasts, and has co-developed the widely used forecast package since 2015. Mitchell is known for his user-friendly designs for statistical software, and he has recently been applying these design ideas to create vectorised data structures of distributions and time using vctrs.

#### Format

15 minute talk.
